        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a completely unpretentious, down-home macaroni and cheese recipe just like my grandma and mom always made. A simple white sauce where you add cheese and a few other flavors with macaroni and a potato chip crust.</p>
        <p>This recipe makes a lot, I like to make two pans so I can take one to a pot luck and have the other one to keep in the fridge for later. It's an easy recipe to adjust down if you only want to make one pan.</p>

            <h2>How to Prepare </h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes; drain.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Melt butter in a large pot over medium-low heat. Slowly add flour to butter, whisking constantly; cook until brown and the mixture no longer smells of flour, about 5 minutes. Pour 1 cup milk into the flour mixture, whisking continually until fully incorporated, about 45 seconds; repeat twice.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add remaining 3 cups milk to the mixture, whisking to incorporate. Stir Worcestershire sauce, mustard powder, onion powder, and cayenne pepper into the mixture; season with salt and black pepper.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Reduce heat to low. Cook sauce, whisking frequently, until it begins to thicken, about 10 minutes. Add about half the package of shredded Cheddar cheese; stir continually until the cheese melts completely. Repeat with remaining half package of Cheddar cheese and the American cheese, about 4 ounces at a time. Once cheese is entirely incorporated, remove sauce from heat.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir drained macaroni into the cheese sauce to coat. Divide macaroni between two 9x13-inch baking dishes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mix crushed potato chips, 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese, and Parmesan cheese in a bowl. Top the macaroni with the potato chip mixture evenly. Spray the potato chip mixture with cooking spray.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake in preheated oven until the crust is golden brown and the sauce is bubbling, 35 to 45 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Congrats the food is ready to eat, enjoy!
